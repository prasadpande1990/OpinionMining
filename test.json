He is affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery. You can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i am sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i am really drawing a blank. He is always on time in seeing his patients.","type":"review","business_id":"vcNAWiLM4dR7D2nwwJ7nCA"}

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don not get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why is not anyone answering the phone?  It is incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It is with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vcNAWiLM4dR7D2nwwJ7nCA"}

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He is been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He does not judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vcNAWiLM4dR7D2nwwJ7nCA"}

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they will put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vcNAWiLM4dR7D2nwwJ7nCA"}

The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance does not pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can not pay for my bill because I am a student and do not have any cash flow at this current time. I can not believe the Doctor would not give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that was not necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can not do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits.
