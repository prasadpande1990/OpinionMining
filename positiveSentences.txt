He will be missed very much.I think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!

I love Dr. Goldberg.

Today I actually got to see the doctor a few minutes early!

You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them.

i am sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i am really drawing a blank.

Can not say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country.It is really easy to get an appointment.

Best doctor I have ever had, and I have had a bunch after moving around a lot in the past 25 years.

We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.

Good listener, friendly & straightforward.

Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had.

Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke.

Dr. Goldberg has been my doctor for years and I like him.

really, what more do you need?

He is been great over the years and is really all about the big picture.

he is nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing.

Highest recommendation.
