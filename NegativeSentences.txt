And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent.

I do not know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office.

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG.

The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor.

Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I have had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.

He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him.

Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.

It is with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.

I can not believe the Doctor would not give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that was not necessary and was strictly preventative.

I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.

It is incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.

He seems very engaged with his patients and his demeanor is friendly, yet authoritative.I am glad to have Dr. Goldberg as my doctor.

Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration.
