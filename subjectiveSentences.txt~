And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent.
He will be missed very much.I think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!
I do not know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office.
Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.
I love Dr. Goldberg.
Today I actually got to see the doctor a few minutes early!
You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them.
Can not say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country.It is really easy to get an appointment.
I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG.
We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.
The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor.
Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration.
i am sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i am really drawing a blank.
Good listener, friendly & straightforward.
I can not believe the Doctor would not give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that was not necessary and was strictly preventative.
He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him.
Dr. Goldberg has been my doctor for years and I like him.
It is with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.
really, what more do you need?
Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke.
he is nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing.
I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.
Highest recommendation.
It is incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.
He seems very engaged with his patients and his demeanor is friendly, yet authoritative.
I am glad to have Dr. Goldberg as my doctor.
Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I have had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.
Best doctor I have ever had, and I have had a bunch after moving around a lot in the past 25 years.
He is been great over the years and is really all about the big picture.
Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had.
